  <p>
    The <strong>Communications Express Reporting Tool</strong> is an
    internal-use application developed by Communications Express LLC
    to support accounting, reporting, and operational workflows.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p>
    With explicit user authorization via Intuit OAuth 2.0, the
    Communications Express Reporting Tool may access data from
    QuickBooks Online, including company information, customers,
    vendors, invoices, bills, transactions, and related accounting
    records.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application requests only the minimum scopes necessary to
    perform its intended internal reporting and automation functions.
  </p>

  <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
  <p>
    The application uses Intuit’s OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.
    User QuickBooks credentials are never collected, stored, or
    transmitted by Communications Express LLC.
  </p>

  <p>
    Access tokens and refresh tokens are stored securely and are used
    solely to access authorized QuickBooks Online data on behalf of
    authorized users.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    Accessed data is used exclusively for internal business purposes,
    including reporting, reconciliation, automation, and operational
    analysis. Data is not sold, shared with third parties, or used for
    advertising or marketing.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Transmission and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All data transmissions between the application and Intuit services
    occur over encrypted HTTPS (TLS) connections. Reasonable
    administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards are used
    to protect authorized data against unauthorized access, disclosure,
    or misuse.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Authorized QuickBooks Online data is retained only for as long as
    necessary to support internal business operations. Data retention
    practices are reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with
    operational requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Revocation and Disconnection</h2>
  <p>
    Users may revoke the application’s access to QuickBooks Online at
    any time through their QuickBooks Online account settings. Upon
    revocation, the application will no longer be able to access
    QuickBooks Online data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
  <p>
    Requests related to data access or deletion may be directed to the
    contact listed below. Reasonable efforts will be made to respond to
    such requests in a timely manner.
